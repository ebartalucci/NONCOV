# IDEA

start with supervised ml and find out if your approach can predict any meaningful results if given another input noncov type of structure
move to unsupervised ml for searching hidden patterns and structures in our data, e.g. correlations between NMR observables and sth or within themselves
finally try adversary neural networks for generating new and purely synthetic data
