# Post Processing of Orca Outputs

## Bugs to fix
* Finish to extract level of theory information from file using regular expression
* need to make the extract level of theory function general for every line and not only those starting with | 10>
* plot the energy (?)
* extract J coupling data
* extract pair distances from j coupling calculations
* find a way to plot tensors on the molecule and display them as a function of distance
* dia and para plots - use orca diagonalized output from mpi8.out
* CSA in PAS axis frame - use orca diagonalized output from mpi8.out
* Energy plots
* adjust x axis to account initial displacement
* minmax plots
* colors for plots - orange shading is positive shielding while blue shading is negative shielding
